In order to run this Hand Sign recogniton model you need to import the ASL dataset from kaggle and hence proceed with the following steps .
download the program files i.e. run1.py and real_time_asl_recognition.py file
after it create a virtual environment in the VSCODE folder .
Import the asl dataset to a folder named data 
edit path to the same folder as the codes 
copy path od data directory and hence modify the given path in the code 
finally first compile run1.py and execute it and hence after runnig the epochs compile the real_time_asl_recognition.py file .
you will now get the predicted output .
